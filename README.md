# dreamer-pytorch
A PyTorch Implementation of [Dream to Control: Learning Behaviors by Latent Imagination][paper] by Danijar Hafner et.al.

Dreamer learns a world model that predicts ahead in a compact feature space. From imagined feature sequences, it learns a policy and state-value function. The value gradients are backpropagated through the multi-step predictions to efficiently learn a long-horizon policy.
